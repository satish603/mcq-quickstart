    "answerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Intussusception is a pediatric emergency in which a segment of the intestine telescopes into an adjacent segment, leading to obstruction and compromised blood supply. A classic clinical sign is the passage of “red currant jelly” stools, which are a mixture of blood and mucus. It is most common in infants and toddlers and requires prompt medical or surgical intervention. Explanation of (a) ✘ Pyloric stenosis – Characterized by projectile vomiting in infants; no association with bloody stools. (b) ✘ Omphalocele – A congenital abdominal wall defect; not associated with red currant jelly stools. (c) ✘ Gastroschisis – A congenital condition with abdominal contents protruding outside the body; no red jelly-like stools. (d) ✔ Intussusception – Correct; hallmark symptom includes passage of red currant jelly-like stools due to intestinal bleeding and mucus.",

    "answerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Veracity is an ethical principle that means truthfulness or honesty. In healthcare and nursing, it refers to the obligation of professionals to tell the truth to patients, fostering trust and informed decision- making. It is foundational to maintaining ethical standards and patient autonomy in care. Explanation of (a) ✘ Do good – Refers to the principle of beneficence, not veracity. (b) ✘ Do no harm – Refers to non-maleficence, another ethical principle. (c) ✘ Be faithful – Refers to fidelity, which is about keeping promises and commitments. (d) ✔ Tell the truth – Correct; veracity directly translates to truthfulness.",

    "answerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Dispersion refers to the extent to which values in a dataset vary around the central value. Standard deviation, variance, and range are all measures of dispersion, indicating how spread out the data is. However, mode is a measure of central tendency, representing the most frequently occurring value in a dataset, and is not a measure of dispersion. Explanation of (a) ✔ Standard deviation – A key measure of dispersion that indicates variability around the mean. (b) ✔ Variance – Measures the average squared deviation from the mean; a fundamental dispersion metric. (c) ✘ Mode – Correct answer; reflects frequency, not spread. (d) ✔ Range – A simple measure of dispersion showing the difference between the highest and lowest values. 38",

    "answerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Nominal level of measurement is the simplest and most basic level in the hierarchy of measurement scales. It classifies data into distinct categories without any order or quantitative value. These categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Numbers may be used, but only as labels, not to indicate order or magnitude. The attributes of magnitude, equal intervals, and an absolute zero belong to the ratio level of measurement, not nominal. Explanation of (a) ✔ It is the lowest – Correct; nominal is the basic level of measurement. (b) ✔ Categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive – True for nominal scales. (c) ✔ Involves assigning numbers to represent categories – Correct; used only as identifiers. (d) ✘ It has all three attributes – Incorrect; this describes ratio level, not nominal.",

    "explanation": "The fetal pancreas begins to develop early in gestation, but insulin synthesis and secretion typically begin around the 12th week of intrauterine life. This insulin plays an important role in fetal growth and metabolism, especially in the regulation of blood glucose levels. From this point onward, the fetus can respond to maternal glucose levels with its own insulin production. Explanation of (a) ✘ 6 weeks – Pancreatic tissue begins forming, but insulin is not yet produced. (b) ✘ 24 weeks – By this time, insulin production is already well-established. (c) ✔ 12 weeks – Correct; marks the initiation of fetal insulin synthesis. (d) ✘ 3 weeks – Too early; major organ development has not yet begun. 44",
