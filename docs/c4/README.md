# C4 Model Documentation

This folder documents the system using the C4 model (Context → Containers → Components → Code). It is based on the current repository structure and the Project Guide.

- Level 1 — Context: `context.md`
- Level 2 — Containers: `containers.md`
- Level 3 — Components: `components.md`
- Level 4 — Code notes (selective): `code.md`
- Scenarios (sequence-style flows): `scenarios.md`

Diagrams use Mermaid for portability. If your renderer does not support Mermaid, the textual bullets still convey the structure clearly.
