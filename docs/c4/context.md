The product is a multi-tenant MCQ quiz and interview practice application. It serves end-users (candidates) on web browsers and integrates with external AI services and search engines for SEO.

## Scope and Purpose

- AI-powered: generate MCQs and run a virtual interviewer.
- SEO-friendly landing pages and sitemaps.

## Primary Actors
- Candidate: practices quizzes, views scores, uses AI tools.
- Search Engine: crawls SEO pages and sitemaps.
- Analytics Platform (GA4): observes usage (optional).

## Relationships
- Candidate uses the Web App.
- Web App stores quiz sessions in localStorage.
- API routes persist score history to a local JSON file (development) or to a production database (future/optional).
- API routes call Google Gemini for MCQ generation and interviews.
- Search engines crawl pre-rendered SEO pages and sitemaps.
- GA4 optionally receives usage events.

## Notes
- JSON-on-disk persistence is not durable on serverless; switch to DB/KV for production.
- Multi-tenant branding and SEO differ by environment variables.
